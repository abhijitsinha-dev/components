## How I Created This Project

2. **Styled the Components with CSS**:

   - Used Flexbox for card content alignment
   - Created circular profile images with borders
   - Implemented the blue overlay with custom corner shapes
   - Added responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes

3. **Implemented Swiper.js Functionality**:

   - Initialized the Swiper instance with configuration options
   - Set up responsive breakpoints (1 card on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop)
   - Enabled navigation buttons and pagination
   - Added smooth fade transitions and grab cursor

4. **Final Touches**:
   - Added hover effects on buttons and navigation elements
   - Ensured proper spacing between cards
